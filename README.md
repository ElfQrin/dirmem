# dirmem

A collection of shell scripts (commands) to memorize a directory, change to another directory, and go back to the memorized one.

The commands are:

back # Go back to the memorized directory

cdm NEWDIR # Memorize current directory and change to NEWDIR

dirm [DIR] # Memorize the given DIR directory. If no directory is given then the current directory is memorized. Then you can change directory with traditional cd rather than cdm

ldirm # List memorized directory

showdirm # Show (Echo) memorized directory

up # Go one directory up (pretty much like cd .. )

upm # Memorize current directory and go one directory up
